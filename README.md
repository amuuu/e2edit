**e2edit** is a Unity sample project demonstrating how to use the [RtMidi plugin]
to communicate with MIDI devices via vendor-specific system exclusive messages.

[RtMidi plugin]: https://github.com/keijiro/jp.keijiro.rtmidik

This project is specifically designed for editing sequence patterns on the
KORG electribe (Electribe 2). While the user interface is still under
development and not yet suitable for practical use, the code provides a
reference implementation of how to interact with MIDI devices using the RtMidi
APIs.
